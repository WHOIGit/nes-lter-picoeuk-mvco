This is a 16-year time series of the abundance of eukaryote picophytoplankton at 4 meters depth at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory, about 3 km south of Katama Beach, Edgartown, Massachusetts, USA. Picophytoplankton were sensed in situ by a submersible flow cytometer (FlowCytobot, or FCB). Sampling frequency was continuous at hourly intervals with some exceptions (e.g., winter in some years). For years 2003, 2004, and 2006, this dataset is a new version of previously published data available in NOAA NCEI.
