This is a 19-year time series of the abundance of eukaryote picophytoplankton and Synechococcus at 4 meters depth at the Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory, about 3 km south of Katama Beach, Edgartown, Massachusetts, USA. Picophytoplankton were sensed in situ by a submersible flow cytometer (FlowCytobot, or FCB). Sampling frequency was continuous at approximately 20-minute intervals binned to hourly resolution with some exceptions (e.g., winter in some years). This time series is ongoing for Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER).
