# Data acquisition

Data were acquired by a moored submersible flow cytometer (FlowCytobot, or FCB) that was mounted on the offshore tower at Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. Sampling frequency was continuous at approximately 20-minute intervals with some time intervals missing usually during winter but also when the observatory was being serviced between Sept. 2018 and Nov. 2019.
The FCB (described by Olson et al., 2003, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0967-0637(03)00003-7) is used to count cells for populations of photoautotrophs (Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes). The FCB automatically runs bead samples approximately once per day. Data for picoeukaryotes include small eukaryotes that exceed the typical picoplankton size.

# Data processing

Data processing involved classifying observations as eukaryote picoplankton based on their scattering and fluorescence signatures, calculating concentrations based on the volume of water sampled at each time point, and binning to hourly resolution with code available in GitHub: https://github.com/hsosik/NES-LTER/tree/master/fcb_processing. Time of sampling needed to be corrected from local to UTC for some of the early years in the time series. 
These data serve as input to a division rate model by Fowler et al., 2020, http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3708062.
These data serve as the raw data for the derived data products in Fowler et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1918439117.

# Additional data cleaning and quality assurance

Additional data cleaning and metadata template assembly to align with SeaDataCloud SDN data management protocols for Flow Cytometer data were performed with code available on GitHub: https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-picoeuk-mvco. We added attributes to provide spatial context to the data table and assured that the temporal coverage and values for cell concentration were within expected ranges.

# Differences from previous versions

Although the definition changed for the previously used column header concentration_picoeuk, data from the previous version of this package are equivalent to those contained in this new version.
This new version adds the abundance of Synechococcus; a previous version of these data is available at: Hunter-Cevera et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jm8s7. 
For years 2003, 2004, and 2006, this dataset is a new version of previously published data available in NOAA NCEI Oceanographic Data Archive: NODC Accession 0002299, NODC Accession 0002722, NODC Accession 0036656.
