# Data acquisition

Data were acquired by a moored submersible flow cytometer (FlowCytobot, or FCB) that was mounted on the offshore tower at Martha's Vineyard Coastal Observatory. Sampling frequency was continuous at hourly intervals with some exceptions (e.g., approx. 4 mos at the beginning of 2004, 2005, and 2006, August 2007, December 2008, February and October 2014, approx. 3 mos at the beginning of 2015 and 2017, and February 2016).
The FCB is equipped with a syringe pump for volumetric sample delivery and is used to count cells for populations of photoautotrophs (Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes) and heterotrophic prokaryotes. The FCB runs bead samples every 20 hours, with results informing the cell classification process. Data for Synechococcus are available elsewhere (https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jm8s7). Data includes small eukaryotes that exceed the typical picoplankton size, consistent with the definition that cell cycle within this group may generate cells with size greater than 2 microns http://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/F02/current/F0200004/.

# Data processing

Data processing involved classifying observations as eukaryote picoplankton based on their scattering and fluorescent signatures, then calculating concentrations based on the volume of water sampled at each time point, with code available in GitHub: https://github.com/hsosik/NES-LTER/tree/master/fcb_processing. Time of sampling needed to be corrected from local to UTC for some of the early years in the time series. Data for the entire time series were processed; thus, for years 2003, 2004, and 2006, this dataset is a new version of data previously published by Robert J. Olson, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (2010) available in NOAA NCEI Oceanographic Data Archive: NODC Accession 0002299, NODC Accession 0002722, NODC Accession 0036656.
These data serve as input to a model with software available at https://github.com/beefowler/Eukaryote_Procedures [will be able to cite Zenodo]. These data serve as the raw data for the derived data products in [we can cite your PNAS paper here as well as link to DOI in EDI landing page].

# Additional data cleaning and quality assurance

Additional data cleaning and metadata template assembly to align with SeaDataCloud SDN data  management protocols for Flow Cytometer data were performed with code available on GitHub: https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-picoeuk-mvco. We added attributes to provide spatial context to the data table and assured that the temporal coverage and values for cell concentration were within expected ranges.
